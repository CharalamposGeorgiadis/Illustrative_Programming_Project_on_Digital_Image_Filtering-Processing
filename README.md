# DigitalImageFiltering-Processing
Illustrative Programming Project on Digital Image Filtering and Processing for Python 3.7 using openCV.
The project is separated into 3 chapters:

Image Noise: Contains functions for corrupting an image with Gaussian, Salt and Pepper and Multiplicative noise.
Image Filterting: Contains algorithsm for filtering an image that has been corrupted by noise.
Image Processing: Contains algorithms for Image Halftoning, Image Interpolation and Histogram Equalization.

The project was supervised by Ioannis Pitas, professor at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

The following algorithms are found in the book "Digital Image Processing Algorithms and Applications" by I. Pitas and were converted from C to Python for this project, as instructed by professor Pitas, with some modifications made to improve their performance and effectiveness:

1: Multistage Median Filtering
2: Weighted Median Filtering
3: Running Median Filtering
4: Running Max\min Filtering
5: Image Halftoning using Graylevel Binary Fonts
6: Image Halftoning using Pseudorandom Thresholding
7: Zero-Order Hold Interpolation
8: Image Decimation/Zooming

Each algorithm is separated into three folder:
Exercise: Contains the description of an exercise so that someone can write the algorithm from scratch, as well as a Power Point presentation that contains examples of how the algorithm should affect an image.

Help: Contains some helpful notes for each algorithm.
Solution: Contains the complete code, along with input and output examples.
